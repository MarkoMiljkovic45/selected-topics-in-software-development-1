# Selected Topics in Software Development 1
Solutions to laboratory exercises related to the Selected Topics in Software Development 1 ("Odabrana poglavlja razvoja programske potpore 1") course at FER 2022/23 led by prof. dr. sc. Marko Čupić.

> ## Course description
> Colloquially known as *Čupić's Java 1*. Development of applications with graphical user interface based on object component model. Automatic build of projects, testing and source code management.

> ## Course contents
> - Development of applications with graphical user interface
> - Programming environments that automate parts of program construction processes (e.g., automated builds)
> - Program testing, performance analysis, and optimization, Tools for software version control, Testing tools including static and dynamic analysis tools
> - Abstract data types and their implementation (stacks, queues, priority queues, sets, maps), Linked lists, Hash tables, including strategies for avoiding and resolving collisions, Regular expressions
> - Development of applications with graphical user interface
> - Thread management and context switching, Synchronization and communication, Mutual-exclusion, Semaphores and monitors, Multiprocessor issues, Other common features of virtual machines, such as class loading, threads, and security
> - Block ciphers and modes of operation, Message integrity and hashing, Public Key Infrastructure support for digital signature and encryption and its challenges
> - Events and event handlers, Externally-generated events and program-generated events, Separation of model, view, and controller, Canonical uses of event-driven programming (GUIs, mobile devices, robots, servers), Defining event handlers/listeners

> ## Learning Outcomes
> 1. Develop graphical application based on object model
> 2. Apply components modeled by classes and interfaces
> 3. Select appropriate components with respect to needed functionality
